# Getting started 

## Forking 🍴

- There will be a `Fork` button on the top right corner of the repo. Click on it.
- This will create a copy of the repo in your GitHub account.

## Cloning 🌀

- After the fork is done, you will be redirected to your forked repo.
- The next step is to clone the repo to your local storage.
- Open your terminal and enter the following command and hit enter.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MilanCommunity/Milan-Backend.git
```
- This will clone the repo to your local storage and you can start working on it.

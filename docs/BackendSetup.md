# Backend Setup

Follow the below setup to setup the backend locally. We are using `npm` as the
package manager. So make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed in your
system.

**If not installed, please read
[installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).**

## Installing dependencies ⏳

- Open your terminal and navigate to the `Milan-Backend` directory.
- Type `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Once the installation is done, you can start the frontend server by typing
  `npm start`.
- This should start the frontend server on `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Techstack overview 🌀

- We are currently using `ExpressJS v4` along with `MongoDB v6` as the backend
  framework.
- We are using `Nodemon` for the hot reloading.
- List of all the other dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file.

## Setting up `.env`

We use a `.env` file using the `dotenv` package inside the root of the `server`
directory.

You must create a `.env` file similar to **[.env.example](../.env.example)** file, remember that if you are using your own database the data might vary.
